    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Proof the yeast: Place the warm water in a large bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved. After 5 minutes, stir if the yeast hasn’t dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating it is active and alive.</li>
        <li>Make and knead the pizza dough: Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil to the bowl. Using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for 1 minute. Then, replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment. Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes. If you don’t have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand. The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it’s too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rise: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil. At this point, you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp cloth.</li>
        <li>Shape and top the dough: Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions. Press each portion into a greased 10-12 inch pizza pan. Spread the tomato sauce over each crust, leaving a small border around the edges. Top with your desired toppings, including mozzarella cheese, fresh basil leaves, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
