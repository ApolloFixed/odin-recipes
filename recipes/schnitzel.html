    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A schnitzel is a breaded and fried cutlet of meat, typically made with pork, chicken, veal, beef, or turkey. The dish originated in Austria and Germany, where it is a popular comfort food. A traditional schnitzel is made by pounding the meat thinly, coating it with flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs, and then frying it in oil until crispy and golden brown.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pound the chicken: Use a meat mallet or a rolling pin to pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken: In a shallow dish, mix together the flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Dredge the pounded chicken breasts in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>Dip in eggs: Dip the flour-coated chicken breasts in the beaten eggs, making sure they are fully coated.</li>
        <li>Bread the chicken: Roll the egg-coated chicken breasts in the breadcrumbs, pressing the crumbs gently onto the meat to ensure they stick.</li>
        <li>Fry the schnitzel: Heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the breaded chicken breasts for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the schnitzel hot with lemon wedges on the side. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice over the top of the schnitzel for added flavor.</li>
    </ol>
