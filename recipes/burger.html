    <h2>Ingredients needed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1,5 pounds of lean ground beef</li>
        <li>onions</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>

        <li>tomato</li>
        <li>ketchup</li>
        <li>mayo</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the beef, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, ground mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. (Do not put the salt in the mixture; you’ll add it later.)</li>
        <li>Using your hands, mix until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Form the meat into 4 large meatballs (about 4½ oz each).</li>
        <li>Pat each ball into a 1-inch-thick disc; smooth out the edges as best you can. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or until ready to cook.</li>
        <li>Turn on your exhaust fan and heat a 12-inch cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the patties from the fridge and season all over with the salt.</li>
        <li>Coat the hot pan evenly with the oil. Place the burgers on the skillet one at a time, firmly smashing them flat with a metal spatula until about ¼-inch thick before adding and smashing the next one.</li>
        <li>Let cook for about 2 minutes until nicely browned and crusty on the bottom. Flip the burgers.</li>
        <li>Top the burgers with the cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2 minutes more for medium-rare to medium burgers, or 3 minutes for medium to medium-well burgers.</li>
        <li>Place the burgers on the buns and serve with toppings of choice.</li>
        <li>Serve your delicious burger and enjoy!</li>
