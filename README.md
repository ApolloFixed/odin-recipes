# odin-recipes
first project from the odin course

In this project, I learned how to deal with ordered and unordered lists, anchor tags (pictures and links) and also with boilerplates of web pages.
I started by creating the main page, just as the project required, then once the main page was set and the relative links to the other pages were made, I started working on the first page that I would use as a boilerplate for the other 2 pages. Once I have written the pseudocode for the page, then I started to fill in the lines of code. I used ordered and unordered lists, I linked pictures with an absolute link path and I also used headings and paragraphs.

All in all it was a nice and easy project for memorizing some things an structures.
